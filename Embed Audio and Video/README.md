To embed audio and video files into your web page, HTML provides the <audio> and <video> tags. These elements allow you to integrate multimedia content directly into your page without needing third-party plugins like Flash.

**Example of Embedding Audio and Video:**

**Explanation:**

1. Audio Embed:
o The <audio> element is used to embed audio files. The controls attribute provides play, pause, and volume controls for the user. 
o The <source> tag inside the <audio> element specifies the audio file and its type (e.g., MP3 in this case).
o The text inside the <audio> element ("Your browser does not support the audio element.") is a fallback message in case the user's browser does not support the audio tag.

2. Video Embed:
o The <video> element is used to embed video files. The controls attribute provides the standard video player controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen, etc.).
o Multiple <source> tags are used for providing different video formats (MP4, WebM, Ogg) to ensure compatibility across different browsers.
o The text inside the <video> element ("Your browser does not support the video tag.") is a fallback message for browsers that do not support the video tag.

3. Attributes:
o controls: Adds basic controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the media element.
o width: Specifies the width of the video player (for videos).
o src: The file path to the media content. Replace "your-audio-file.mp3" and "your-video-file.mp4" with the actual paths to your media files.

**Customization:**

• You can customize the width, height, and other attributes of the video or audio element.
• For audio, you can use different file formats such as .ogg, .wav, and .flac depending on your needs.
• For video, using multiple formats (MP4, WebM, Ogg) ensures that the video is compatible with a variety of browsers.

**Additional Features:**

• Autoplay: You can add the autoplay attribute to automatically start playing the media when the page loads.
• Loop: Add the loop attribute to make the audio or video loop indefinitely.
• Muted: Add the muted attribute to start the audio or video with the sound turned off.

**Example with Autoplay and Loop:**

html
<audio controls autoplay loop>
<source src="your-audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.

</audio>
<video width="600" controls autoplay loop>
<source src="your-video-file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
<source src="your-video-file.webm" type="video/webm">
<source src="your-video-file.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

**Conclusion:**

Embedding audio and video in a web page is straightforward with the <audio> and <video> tags. By specifying different 
file formats and using attributes like controls, autoplay, and loop, you can easily integrate multimedia into your website.
