To design a timetable for a department, we can use an HTML table and apply some CSS to highlight the most important periods. 
 Below is an example of a weekly timetable for a department with some important periods highlighted.

HTML and CSS Code for Department Timetable:

Explanation:

1. Timetable Structure:
o The timetable is represented as an HTML table, where each row represents a time period during the day, and each column represents a weekday.

2. Highlighting Important Periods:
o The .important class is applied to the most crucial subjects, making them stand out with a red background (#ffcccb).
o The .highlight class is used for additional important subjects that are highlighted with a light yellow background (#f4e542).

3. CSS Styling:
o Font styling is used to improve readability (font-family: Arial, sans-serif).
o The table is styled with padding, borders, and alternating background colors to make it easy to read.
o Bold and larger font size is used for the important periods to make them more noticeable.

4. Timetable Content:
o The timetable includes common subjects such as Mathematics 101, Data Structures, Physics, Software Engineering, etc.
o The highlighted periods (using the .important class) are the most crucial periods of the day, such as the main courses or exams.

5. Responsive Design:
o The table is designed to be responsive, adjusting the width based on the screen size.

Customization:
• You can replace the subjects with your department's actual subjects.
• You can adjust the timetable duration, days, and periods according to your schedule.
• You can also change the highlight colors based on your department's theme or design preferences.

his HTML and CSS setup will present a department timetable with clearly highlighted important periods and a well-organized layout.
