Explanation:

1. HTML Structure:
o An input field is provided to the user for entering a number.
o A button is provided that triggers the checkEvenOrOdd() function when clicked.
o The result will be displayed in a <p> element with the id result.

2. JavaScript Logic:
o The function checkEvenOrOdd() retrieves the number entered by the user, checks if it's valid, and determines if it's even or odd by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (num % 2 === 0).
o The result is then displayed in the result paragraph.

Example Usage:

When you open the HTML file in a browser:
• If you enter 4 and click "Check", the output will be: 4 is an even number.
• If you enter 7 and click "Check", the output will be: 7 is an odd number.

How to Run:

1. Save the above code as an .html file (e.g., even_or_odd_checker.html).
2. Open the file in any browser.
3. Enter a number and click the "Check" button to see whether the number is even or odd.
