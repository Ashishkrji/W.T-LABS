**Explanation:**

1. HTML Structure:
o An input field allows the user to enter a number.
o A button is provided to trigger the multiplication table generation.
o A <ul> element with the id tableResult is used to display the multiplication table.

2. JavaScript Logic:
o The generateTable() function retrieves the number entered by the user, checks if it's valid, and generates the multiplication table from 1 to 10.
o The results are displayed as a list of items (<li>) inside the <ul> element.

**Example Usage:**

When you open this in a browser and enter 5, it will display the following multiplication table:

Copy

5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50

**How to Run:**

1. Copy the code above and save it as an .html file (e.g., multiplication_table.html).
2. Open the file in any browser.
3. Enter a number and click the "Generate Table" button to see the multiplication table for that number.
