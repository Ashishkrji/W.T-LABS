To create a link that moves to a specific section within a single page (rather than loading another page), you can use internal links. This is done by creating anchor links that point to elements with unique id attributes. When the link is clicked, the browser scrolls to the specified section within the same page.

Example: Moving Within a Single Page Here is a step-by-step guide:
1. Define the sections of your page using the id attribute.
2. Create links that refer to these ids.

Explanation:

• Anchor Links (<a href="#id">):
o In the <nav>, each link has an href pointing to a specific section's id. For example, <a href="#section1"> links to the section with the id="section1".

• Sections with id attributes:
o Each section in the content has a unique id (e.g., id="section1", id="section2", id="section3"). When you click on a link, the page scrolls to that section.

• CSS:
o Simple styles are added to make the navigation links appear fixed at the top and to separate the sections visually for better clarity.
How It Works:

When you click a link, the browser automatically scrolls to the section with the corresponding id within the same page. This method does not reload the page, making the navigation smooth and fast.

Customization:
• You can add more sections or modify the styles to suit your needs.
• You can also add smooth scrolling using CSS for a better user experience:

css
html {
scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

This will ensure the page smoothly scrolls to the desired section rather than jumping directly to it.
