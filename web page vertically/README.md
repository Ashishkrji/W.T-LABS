To divide a webpage vertically into two panes and display the logos of your college and university in the left and right panes, you can 
use a combination of HTML and CSS. This can be easily achieved with the help of CSS for layout styling. Here’s an example of how to do it:

HTML and CSS Code:

Explanation:

1. Flexbox Layout:
o The .container class uses display: flex to create a flexible layout where its child elements (the left and right panes) are arranged side by side.
o The flex: 1 on the .left-pane and .right-pane ensures that each pane takes up 50% of the available width, dividing the page vertically into two equal parts.

2. Pane Styling:
o Each pane has its background color set (#f4f4f4 for the left pane and #e9e9e9 for the right pane) to visually distinguish between the two areas.
o The display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; ensures that the logos are centered both horizontally and vertically inside their respective panes.

3. Logo Image Styling:
o The logos are placed within the <img> tags, and the .logo class ensures that the logos are responsive and do not exceed 80% of the width and height of their respective panes (max-width: 80%; max-height: 80%).

4. Responsive Design: 
o The layout is designed to be responsive, meaning the logos will scale and adjust based on the available space. If the browser window is resized, the logos will maintain their proportions within the two panes.

Customization:
• Replace "college-logo.png" and "university-logo.png" with the actual paths to your college and university logos.
• You can adjust the max-width and max-height properties to control the size of the logos based on your preference.

Result:
• The page will display two vertically split panes, with the college logo in the left pane and the university logo in the right pane.
Both logos will be centered inside their respective panes and will scale appropriately as the browser window is resized.
