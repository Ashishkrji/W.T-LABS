To create a scrolling letterhead for your college that moves from right to left, you can use HTML along with CSS. Here's an example of how you can implement it using the <marquee> tag (which is an older tag and no longer recommended in modern web design) and CSS for better control over the animation.

Since the <marquee> tag is deprecated in HTML5, it's better to use CSS animation to achieve the same effect. Below is a simple example where we display a letterhead for your college and have it scroll from right to left:

HTML and CSS Example for Scrolling Letterhead:

Explanation:

1. HTML Structure:
o The .letterhead-container is the main container for the letterhead.
o Inside this container, the .letterhead-text class holds the actual letterhead content (like the college name, address, and contact).

2. CSS Styling:
o .letterhead-container has a fixed width (100% of the page) and hides any overflow (to ensure scrolling text stays inside the container).
.letterhead-text contains the scrolling effect using the CSS @keyframes rule. It starts from the right (translateX(100%)) and moves to the left (translateX(-100%)).
o The animation: scroll-left 10s linear infinite; applies the scroll animation, which lasts for 10 seconds and loops infinitely.

3. Animation:
o The @keyframes rule defines the animation, creating a smooth left-to-right scroll.
o The animation makes the text scroll from right to left across the page. 

Customization:

• Colors: Modify the background color and text color in the .letterhead-container to match your college's official colors.
• Speed: You can change the 10s value in the animation property to adjust the speed of the scroll.
• Content: Replace the content inside .letterhead-text with your actual college letterhead details like name, address, and contact info.

This solution is simple and uses modern CSS animation for smooth scrolling. It’s a good alternative to the outdated <marquee> tag.
